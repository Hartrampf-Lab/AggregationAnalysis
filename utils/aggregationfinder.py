class AggregationFinder:
    """
    This data analysis tool was developed for finding and identifying
    points of aggregation based on the peak angle, i.e. the angle of
    the deprotection peak. The tool provides two different readouts
    for aggregation, i.e. two different methods for finding
    aggregation. One method is based on summing the rows of the
    slope matrix. Here the point of aggregation is definend as the
    argmax (index of max) of the cumulative gradient sum while the
    maximum gradient is the extent of aggregation. It has been
    observed that a gradient value higher than 10 is usually
    consistent with aggregation. The other method is based on fitting
    a sigmoid on the angle trace:

    (a/(1+exp(d*x-b)))+c

    The fitting provides the 4 parameters of the sigmoid, which we
    can use to determine where the aggregation will be happening
    (b/d), how much (a) and how fast (d) it is happening. In order
    for the two methods not to be confused by sharp peaks introduced
    by temperature anomalies, any peaks resulting from deprotections
    performed with activation temperatures 20% higher or lower than
    the local median (median of tempertures within the synthesis)
    will be trimmed. The trimming happens by setting the peak angle
    to the average between the next and previous peak angle.

    --------------------------------------
    Attributes:
    df : pd.DataFrame
        the dataframe to operate on.
        Must include columns param, "serial_n", "AA Name", "AA number", "t_loop"
    param : str
        the parameter onto which the aggregation computations will performed.
        This must be the name of one of the columns in df.


    --------------------------------------
    Usage:
    - Define an AggregationFinder instance. This must include a df and a param
      as shown below. In this example the peak angle will be used as the
      target of the aggreggation computations. It is strongly advised to use
      the Peak Angle. However a different parameter such as "first_diff"
      (aggregation factor) or "Area" could also be used:
    >>> param = "Peak Angle"
    >>> aggr_finder = AggregationFinder(df,param)

    - Use the find_aggregation method to compute the sigmoid fitting and the
      cumulative slope. This method will return the DataFrame which you
      provided as attribute concatenated with the gradient and sigmoid prediction,
      aswell as a new DataFrame containing the parameters of the sigmoid and the
      max&argmax of the cumulative slope. You can recycle the df if you want
      to change param, but do not recycle the DataFrame containing the predicted
      paramameters as it will be overwritten. On the find_aggregation method you
      can specify the trimming interval using the interval parameter. In other
      words, you can specify how much percentage difference from the median the
      deprotection temperture (t_loop) needs to be for the peak to be trimmed.
      This is set to 0.2 (20%) as default.
    >>> df, aggr_angle_df = aggr_finder.find_aggregation(interval=0.2)

    - Finally you can plot the aggregation prediction of the 2 methods using the
      plot_aggregation method. here you need to specify the serial number as
      parameter sn. This is necessary to distinguish between the various sequences
      in the dataset. Even if you may only have one sequence, you still need to
      specify it. the method will plot two subplots. In the upper you will see the
      trimmed param in red and the fitted sigmoid in blue. On this subplot you will also
      see a brown vertical line corresponding to the prediction of aggregation of the
      cumulative slope method and a yellow vertical line corresponding to the prediction of
      aggregation of the sigmoid method. In the bottom plot you will see the 
      cumulative slope in blue and the same brown line. The parameters returned
      by the two aggregation finidng methods are printed below the plot but can also
      be found on the aforementioned DataFrame. You can also save this figure by
      specifying the name of the file as a string followed by the .pdf or .jpg suffix:
